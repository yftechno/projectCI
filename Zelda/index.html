      <p>Legend of Zelda is one of the prime examples of the celtic-like game, as a majority of it's style is inspired by celtic tales. There are magic items and concepts that are shared within lots of the games, below we list a few.</p>
      <h5>Epona</h5>
      <div id="loz-epona" style="display:flex; justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">
        <iframe width="382" height="253" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fq8pAK5tlUc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p style="padding:5px;">Epona, or link's horse in all Legend of Zelda games are a clear reference to the Celtic Goddess Epona. Epona, the horse also shows celtic-like traits as it is a red horse, with a white mane. It is also always the best horse in comparison to any other horses, and in many of the games it was being trained to be ridden by rulers of the kingdom. The horse itself is very fast, but it's true positive trait is it's loyalty, which no animal matches it in.</p>
        <p style="padding:5px;">Interestingly enough, it seems that the goddess Epona was celebrated in Rome (Phyllis Fray Bober, <i>Epona, Déesse Gauloise des Chevaux, Protectrice des Cavaliers in American Journal of Archaeology</i>). This can be considered to be nodded at by the fact that the Epona the Horse is commonly being raised by a ranch called the Romani Ranch. This could be coincidence, but that is very doubtful.</p>

      <h5>Lost Woods</h5>
      <div id="loz-lostwoods" style="display:flex; justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">
        <p style="padding:5px;"> Link travels to many locations, one of which is more celtic-like as the Lost Woods. The lost woods is a place that seems to magically appear in woodland areas (like the Kokori Forest in Ocarina of Time). The transition between from outside of the lost woods to inside is normally easy to notice, but easy to get lost within. The common method to attempt to escape is through the use of the enchanting melody that is playing within the woods.</p>
