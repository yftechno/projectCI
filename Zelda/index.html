      <h5>Epona</h5>

        <p style="padding:5px;">Epona, or link's horse in all Legend of Zelda games are a clear reference to the Celtic Goddess Epona. Epona, the horse also shows celtic-like traits as it is a red horse, with a white mane. It is also always the best horse in comparison to any other horses, and in many of the games it was being trained to be ridden by rulers of the kingdom. The horse itself is very fast, but it's true positive trait is it's loyalty, which no animal matches it in.</p>

      <h5>Lost Woods</h5>
      <div id="loz-lostwoods" style="display:flex; justify-content:center;">
        <p style="padding:5px;"> Link travels to many locations, one of which is more celtic-like as the Lost Woods. The lost woods is a place that seems to magically appear in woodland areas (like the Kokori Forest in Ocarina of Time). The transition between from outside of the lost woods to inside is normally easy to notice, but easy to get lost within. The common method to attempt to escape is through the use of the enchanting melody that is playing within the woods.</p>
