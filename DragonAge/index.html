    <main>
      <p>Dragon Age is a video game gone tabletop, which had taken some common fantasy troupes and turned them to their own. One concept that they changed to their own, with keeping some inspiration would be the otherworld.</p>
      <h5>The Fade</h5>
      <p>The Fade in Dragon Age is a otherworld that is the land that gives the powers to those who do magic. They have creatures, like demons and other things, within them that trap them there. Like the otherworld, this place creeps into reality, though the rules are not the same. The fade shows up where magic itself is used, though this is not fully standardized on how it encrouches within. The otherworld has a much more standard way of where you can get to the other place, as the otherworld shows up in locations inbetween concepts.</p>
