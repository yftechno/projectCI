      <p>GURPS, otherwise known as Generic Universal Role Playing game, attempts to be as generic it can be so that people could run whatever sort of games they want to run. This also means that they have more creative freedom when creating additional powers and concepts. They had even created a few books just to help add celtic inspiration to their games, one being called Celtic Myth.</p>
      <p>As with most GURPs books, they did research to make sure to try to hit everything they can to hit as many concepts within celtic myths as possible. </p>

      <h5>Gesa</h5>
      <p>Within the rules they present, they bring into action a concept of powers called of which they called Gesa (as they already used Geas) to fit the concept of Irish myths of the ritual vows. In the mythology they are magical vows that required kings or heroes must take. GURPS uses this to allow some players to take these concepts on to build stronger characters who would have restrictions that would highten roleplay.</p>
