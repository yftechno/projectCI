      <p>The World of Darkness has a splat book, or a book that expands the games options, that is very celtic-like. The book is called Changeling.</p>
      <h5>Changelings</h5>
      <div class="wod-changeling">
        <p>In the story of the changelings, you play someone who was kidnapped by the Fae; but unlike most you found your way back home. You get some powers on the way, and different things can happen depending on the story the GM creates.</p>
        <p>Besides this feeling of Celtic-ness we don't see many other things that really show celtic inspiration with the setting. There could be small theme changes that a GM could do to make sure that the game sticks closer to the feeling as well, especially if they wiser about Celtic concepts.</p>
