      <p>Digimon started out as a portable pet simulator game that focuses on dinosaur-like creatures. it wasn't until the later years, when they finally started having shows and other media that they tended to use more celtic concepts in their writings. One of these key features is their concept of the digital world.</p>
      <h5>Digital World</h5>
      <p>Like the celtic otherworld, the digital world is suppose to be another world that is tied to the "real world" through locations that are "inbetween". Commonly, these spaces in Digimon would be places that not only people would normally appear, but also technology is at it's highest. The celtic otherworld, in comparison, would be just places of which would be moving from one to another. The digital world also, like the celtic otherworld, originally did not move at a timerate equal to that of the real world. The digital world moved at a much faster rate, so that if you got stuck there for some time, it might not even be an hour in the real world.</p>
