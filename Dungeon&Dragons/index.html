    <main>
      <p>Dungeons and dragons is the oldest tabletop role playing games, of which has had lots of time to grow and mature and add parts that are more celtic in nature. There are celtic inspirations within the class options for players, there are some spells that also share some celtic-like traits.</p>
      <h5>Druids</h5>
      <p>One of the core classes, and one that has many celtic inspirations. Druids, within the culture of Celtics, was wise sages who knew how to handle the sidhe. Within D&D it is a natural magic class, normally tasked with balancing the natural world and protecting it. They can do things like transform to different animals, or having supernatural (even cetic-like) creatures. They can cast spells, through their dedication to the natural world.</p>
      <h5>Spell: Shillelagh</h5>
      <p>A spell that only Druid can cast, that allows them to substitue their strength score when dealing damage with certain weapons to their wisdom score. This is their casting stat, which means that using it to attack with an weapon is viable for them. This is linked to Celtic culture by the fact that irish used walking sticks called shillelah in their martial arts.</p>
