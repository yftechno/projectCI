        <p>Like books, games can be described by many different factors, one of the most common of those are genres. Within that, there are a group of genres that are only within the gaming community. These genres are called "likes," as the one that started this trend Rouge-likes. I want to start using this concept to describe games even further, by the cultures that inspire them. This site is dedicated to the group of which I am calling "Celtic-like." I have celtic defined below (by the oxford dictionary.) </p>
